*Task: Create an album page with thumbnails and a lightbox-solution.*
Show an album with the matching images depending on the album ID from https://
jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. The page should have an element with the album where the title and ID is visible, together with a grid system with the thumbnails of the images of the album. If you click a thumbnail a bigger version of the image should show.
On the page there should also be buttons to the left and right where you can show the past/next album with a call that does not reload the page.

Album-ID, foto-ID and other data can be found in the json data through the page above.
Using open source third-party frameworks and libraries is fine. Responsiveness isnâ€™t mandatory, but a big plus.
